# Spotify To Youtube Music
A chrome extension that automatically redirect spotify links to youtube music links.

Do you ever get sick of getting spotify links from friends/family and having to go to youtube and search it? Well I had enough and developed the solution.

# Installation Instructions
I apologize that this isn't on the Chrome web store, I refuse to pay Google $5 to publish a free app. 
1. Open up chrome://extensions
2. Slide "Developer Mode" to the right
3. Click "Load Unpacked"
4. Select your cloned directory of this repo

# Mods
You can very easily fork this and make it support your favorite streaming service (if it has keyword based search URLs), you will just need to modify the hardcoded parts of "retUrl" 

# Upcoming
Soon will support album and artist links as well
